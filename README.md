# Titanic Data Analysis – Internship Tasks  

This repository contains my work for the internship tasks where I applied Python and data analysis techniques to the Titanic dataset. The goal of these tasks was to demonstrate data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization skills using real-world data.


##
Tasks Completed  

### **Task 1 – Load and Explore Data**  
- Loaded the Titanic dataset (`titanic_data.csv`) using **Pandas**.  
- Explored its structure: number of rows, columns, data types, and basic statistics.  
- Identified missing values and initial data quality issues.  

### **Task 2 – Clean and Preprocess Data**  
- Handled missing values in key columns (e.g., `Age`, `Embarked`, `Cabin`).  
- Removed duplicates where necessary.  
- Standardized categorical values for consistency.  
- Created a **cleaned version of the dataset** (`titanic_data_cleaned.csv`) and saved it separately for reproducibility.  

### **Task 3 – Visualize Key Insights**  
- Generated different visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:  
  - **Bar plots**: Survival counts by gender and passenger class.  
  - **Histograms**: Distribution of passenger ages.  
  - **Pie charts**: Proportion of survivors vs. non-survivors.  
  - **Boxplots**: Relationship between fare and passenger class.  
- Highlighted important trends, such as higher survival rates among females and first-class passengers.  

## Key Learnings  
- Gained hands-on experience in **data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization**.  
- Learned to maintain a structured repository with **raw and processed data**.  
- Understood how to make projects more **reproducible and professional**.  

## Next Steps  
- Task 4 & 5 will be added soon.
